Merging / Joining data sets

Merging Series based on key
---------------------------

You may be occasionally interested in joining data sets which are
keyed on different index values. This comes down to a simple mapping
problem in the one dimensional case and will be more interesting in
the 2- and 3-D cases, but the basic concept is the same:

::

    >>> s = Series(['six', 'seven', 'six', 'seven', 'six'],
                   index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'])
    >>> t = Series({'six' : 6., 'seven' : 7.})

    >>> s
    a	six
    b	seven
    c	six
    d	seven
    e	six

    >>> s.merge(t)
    a	6.0
    b	7.0
    c	6.0
    d	7.0
    e	6.0
